### *Installation of the linux*
Today I made a bootable usb drive by downloading the Linux ubuntu  ISO in that and the running it on my machine (laptop)
The very next task was to install the lamp on the linux ubuntu and hosting a localhost asthe test result, this was initially giving some problems in the installation but then at last was just able  to run all the commands fro teh installation and the problem then came was to host it locally some commands which were optional of the php were also executed by me. when there was any problem in the execution of any command I refer to Stackoverflow site https://stackoverflow.com/ to find the  aulternative command. This activity  took about one day.

Read about the frappe framework, its functionalities and advantage along with its installation process. Beside that looked over the lamp that was told to install earlier.
